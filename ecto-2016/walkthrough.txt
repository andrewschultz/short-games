Here is a walkthrough for the re-release of A Checkered Haunting. At the end, it also contains some of the mathematical logic the game uses to determine if you put yourself in a no-win situation for the current board. Of course, you can always try again, but if you're interested in seeing when and how you may've messed up, I hope this information is enlightening.

First four ways through are these or a mirror image/rotation. Regardless of where you start, you can follow the conveyor belt. The first four levels each have the church in a different place. The details are after the maps.

The church is in the corner in level 1, on the edge in level 2, and diagonally adjacent to the center in level 3. It is in the center in level 4. The location may change if you have to retry, but this doesn't really make any difference to the puzzle--you can always rotate or flip one board to achieve another.

Now level five is not solvable because of a mathematical trick. You'll learn what it is if you go through the game. Maybe you've seen the problem this game references.

But what happens is, there's a checkerboard to examine. It goes from 8x8 to 6x6 to 4x4 to 5x5. Also, some dominoes appear. They and the checkerboard push you away, so you can't take them on your own.

Then you'll note that there's also a magnet, and you're pulled to it at the start. The magnet can pick up the checkerboard and dominoes. If you get the magnet first, and you get the checkerboard and dominoes later, you can then X the checkerboard until you want to SOLVE it. You're strictly on your honor for this, but the more you examine, the more hints/perspective you get. Eventually examining it just leads to solving it, anyway.

So the solution is to keep examining the checkerboard when you find it in Programmerville (always the last) and then get the magnet once it appears. Then you should be able to stumble across the board and dominoes. While there may be a configuration that gives makes getting the magnet first then getting the other two items impossible, or you may run across a non-magnet first by accident, the game does check for configurations that don't work, and you can always restart. In addition, if we consider the 5x5 map a checkerboard of its own and the corner squares are black and the other squares are white, all the items are on white squares. So if you get a route that takes out everything but the two black squares, you will hit all three items.

So eventually, you should get everything in the right order.

You may notice it's quicker to run into a dead end right away to get to the next checkerboard, and there's no penalty for doing so. This may save a few moves.

The mathematical explanation for this follows: if you label the map of available squares on level 5 like a checkerboard, with black in the corners, there are 13 "black" squares and 11 "red" but you alternate between black and red. So after you've touched 22 squares, the last two will be black. That's a problem, since any path alternates between black and red squares. The first four levels have 12 valid black and red squares each, so you aren't disqualified immediately.

Also, the game detects if 1) you split the board in half or 2) you create two dead ends (you'll have to end in a dead end) or 3) you make a dead end that is the wrong checkerboard color.

1. You can't cover the left and right side of the board after starting at the bottom and running north.

2. You made two dead ends. South of the church and two west of where you are--and you can only end in one.

3. This is subtler, but note that you started on a red square and have to end on a black one. However, you created a red dead end. So you are already out of luck.
